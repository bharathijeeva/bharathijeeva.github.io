I am Bharathi Kannan a Ph.D. student at IISER, Pune  advised by <a href="http://sites.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/" target="_blank">M.S Santhanam.


## Research Interest:

My research aims to build a rigorous foundation for modeling how scientists, machines, and future quantum computers learn about our inherently quantum-mechanical universe (molecules, materials, pharmaceutics, exotic quantum matter, engineered quantum devices, etc).
With the rigorous foundation, I seek to discover new algorithmic tools that enhance one's ability to make predictions about the quantum world.

I utilize tools in quantum information theory, statistical learning theory, computational complexity theory, and quantum many-body physics to study questions such as:
* How to efficiently learn and make predictions about complex quantum systems?
* Could quantum machines learn faster and predict better than classical machines?
* How can machine learning advance quantum technology and physical sciences?

My ultimate dream is to build quantum machines capable of learning and discovering new facets of our universe beyond humans and classical machines.
